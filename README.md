IF FIRST TIME RUNNING:
    first run train.py. It will extract dataset to the same directory where the source files are.
    Then, after it finishes downloading and extracting everything, it starts training the model. If you don't need that (the model in Models is already included), press CTRL + C to abort.

To start predicting:
    Run inferenceModel.py. Press any character to predict next image, ESC to exit.
